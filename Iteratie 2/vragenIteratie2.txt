*use case 4.7: "what about other admins?"
-->

*(p. 12) can you set a tag 'not a bug'  on a bugreport with dependencies that are not resolved or closed?
--> according to the assignment, this is not possible.

* When you subscribe for create bug report. Do you subscribe system specific (all the bugreports), project specific or subsystem specific. 

*use case 4.17: suggest a new tag, do we have to give possible tags (what if there are none)? 

*does a bug report must have a milestone? (assignment: "a bug report can also have a milestone" p. 13)
**when making a bugreport with no milestone chosen to set, do we have to set it to that of the relevant subsystem +1 in the third number, or...?
-->

*notifications: when subscribing for ALL set tags to assigned, do you also subscribe for future bugreports?
--> when newly made, can you have subscribers
** can you subscribe system wide OR do you have to subscribe to a specific bugreport. 
==> "Specific objects of interest" p. 12

*undo only in use case --> can only an admin undo stuff? (we suppose yes, since there is no other use case)
